## Textual IRCRelay Set-up Guide

### Get the Client

First, you'll need do download and install [Textual](http://codeux.com/textual/).

### Adding the Server

You'll be prompted with a welcome screen. You don't need that.

Click "Cancel" and then the "Add Server" button on the left side of the client.

The Add Server screen will look like this:

The Name of the Network is up to you! Since we're setting up a freenode
network, I'm going to call mine IRCRelay Freenode.

Your server and port will match the screenshot.

Make sure to check the Use SSL box.

Your password is the password you signed up for IRCRelay with.

Now, go to the Identity section:

![Username Dialog](https://raw.github.com/ircrelay/ircrelay-client-guides/master/guides/textual/img/username.png)

The only thing you need to change here is the username field. We will
automatically override the rest with the settings you provided when
congfiguring your network on ircrelay.com.

Make sure to go to the settings page in IRCRelay and verifying the username
for this specific network. It is different then the username you signed up with.

That's it for configuration. Click "Save".

### Connect

Last but not least, connect to your server by right clicking on the name of it
in the sidebar and pressing connect:
